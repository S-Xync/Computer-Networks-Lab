1.
The Source IP address is 192.168.1.101
ICMP (1)

2.
Given the total length of IP datagram is 60 bytes
IP header length is 20 bytes

IP datagram length = IP header length + IP payload length
so the payload is of 40 bytes

3.
The packet has not been fragmented. This can be told from the fragment offset as the value of fragment offset is 0 and if the packet has been fragmented, the fragment offset would not be set to 0. And also in the flags of IP header, more fragments flag is not set. And also the Don't fragment flag is set 

4.
must change
header checksum
sequence number
identification field

must stay constant
time to live
protocol version
header length 

5.
The identification field is being incremented with value 1 on server side and also client side.
for example 
on client side,
53757, 53758,....
on server side,
45923, 45924,....
